exjr_,"I have chosen to sticky this post as this is an important matter that should concern us all.

To have an idea of what’s going on, read this excerpt by /u/cocobandicoot:

>	Net neutrality today is about preventing abuse. It protects consumers from mega corporations and Internet service providers from (potentially) making major changes in how the Internet works, including (among other things) the possibility of charging users for the types of content they enjoy, rather than treating all data equally. That's a pretty big deal, and not out of the realm of possibility based on comments from ISPs, as well as a number of examples of how ISPs have already started abusing their power.

>	There isn't enough competition in the ISP market to go without net neutrality, and these corporations are working hard to lobby politicians into enacting laws that prevent or make it difficult for new ISPs to be successful.

>	For all these reasons, if we want the Internet to continue to work the way it has all these years, you should be encouraging your representatives to urge the FCC to keep net neutrality and ""Title II"" (2) regulation.

>	ISPs already have proven that without rules in place, they will behave in a way that can dictate how you use your internet connection.

We don’t have much time left. The Federal Communications Commissions (FCC) will vote to eliminate Net Neutrality on December 14th. 

In the OP, you can put your phone number to let the U.S. Congress now that you don’t want this at all. Verizon, AT&T, Time Warner and Comcast are looking to control what you see and what you can access!

And this is why we need to fight for an open, free internet.

Rules I like to follow :

• Always use a VPN (/r/Nologsvpn). This will encrypt your data so that no third parties are able to get it (ISPs etc) it also helps bypass Geo blocks, and protocol throttling.

• Keep your social media usage as little as possible.

• Use throwaway accounts on Reddit. Especially if you give away identifying information or post in local subreddits.

• Extra tip, use PGP on sensitive exchanges.

WDJ1924,"The mis-direction and public gullibility is staggering.  ""Net Neutrality"" is a wolf in sheep's clothing.  DO THE RESEARCH !  ""Net Neutrality"" by the previous FCC put Internet Services under Title 2 of the Communications  Act of 1934. That's right 1934 !  The Title 
 2 portion of the Communications Act of 1934 controls and regulates landline telephone service. So the former FCC, in the guise of ""Net Neutrality"" equated landline phone service and Internet Services for regulation purposes!!  Who in their right mind can call that a good thing.  The Internet has flourished because it has  NOT been regulated as a landline phone...the past FCC changed that with the ""Net Neutrality"" lie designated Internet Service as a Title 2 service.

""Net Nuetrality"" means two things...government control and taxation.  Look at your Internet bill....no tax is paid!!!!!  Under Title 2 inclusion by the previous FCC, that door is opened !!!

Stop with the nonsensical big bad wolf corporation rhetoric and do the research.  Having Internet Service regulated under an Act created in 1934 for landline telephone service is ridiculous.

Wake up!  The Net Neutrality lie is about Government  Control and the ability to Tax Internet Service at  the Federal level !!!! ",https://www.reddit.com/r/malaysia/comments/7enkwk,2017-11-23 00:38:59,2021-04-2316:01:32

ThomasMaker,"Something doesn't smell right...

First false information in a formula:

""these big companies support net neutrality, so it's bad"", then they proceed to list companies that are actually AGAINST NN.

https://www.opensecrets.org/news/issues/net_neutrality/

VERIZON, ATT, COMCAST have all lobbied excessively AGAINST NN.

There is a reason. You need to dig deeper to understand. They aren't trying to stop censorship. They are censorship. They already censor all over the web. They already censor media from trending on social media. They tell us some links are fake news. Hell, they censor us on this website right now. The hypocrisy is overwhelming. The censorship is here. What people don't get is that it is already happening but ask yourself if sites are already being censored then why do the globalists want NN? It's real simple. They will selectively enforce. They will allow their buddies to break the rules and enforce the rules against their opponents. Better to remove the rules so everyone is on an even playing field and then use anti trust laws already on the books to stop them from targeting businesses. Before NN there were almost no cases of actual abuse. Don't give me some bs link about some isp in Canada. Also, all that abuse was already illegal based on our current laws for antitrust and consumer protections. Right now we need to get rid of the title 2 regulations so people can get more service provider options. Then if your isp starts slowing certain traffic you can switch.

There is an end game here. It is not just what you see right now on the front page. Remove NN, remove title 2, allow more ISPs to compete, if they provide bad service you can switch to one that will not slow traffic. That is the real plan, not reddit's bullshit. And if you want to argue the ISPs will not compete because they like to create monopolies I still say it's better to have no regulation and antitrust laws than regulation that can be selectively enforced by the globalists if they get the right people in office. We aren't going to let them control everything. Things were working just fine before NN and they will work just fine after NN.",https://www.reddit.com/r/malaysia/comments/7enkwk,2017-11-22 20:09:21,2021-04-2316:01:32

,"In the past, I was very vocal about net neutrality but a lot's changed
politically since now & then that makes me think that regardless
of who gets their way & the outcome, this is a very bad time
for anyone to take a reactionary position considering the series of
L's the left has racked up.  Before these regulations were put
in place, all of these nightmare scenarios largely rested upon
corporations buying policy that makes things worse & ISP's
illegally colluding to agree not to compete when it comes to
extorting users into paying for tiered service.
Obviously there's less nightmarish anti-competative actions
that we've already seen happen in the past like slowing down
Netflix but I can't help but feel like Net Neutrality riling people
up every year or 2 could be used as a psychological tactic
that brings people together across party lines in fear of losing
a part of life that we take for granted.  A subconscious reality
check like that is definitely a good idea & without sounding like
I'm making a Thanksgiving pun, right now is a great time to
attempt a little reset like that on our collective political conscience.


And as a side note, I found it interesting that the increased news
coverage suddenly had my parents both asking me what exactly
""net neutrality"" means since they remember me talking about
it years ago.  It's not every day that I get to explain something
complicated without quickly getting a ""Never mind, I'm too dumb
for this"" or ""Since I can't defend my pre-programming in this
discussion, I'm just going to shut the discussion down by slinging
bullshit in all directions until you fatigue & walk away"".",https://www.reddit.com/r/malaysia/comments/7enkwk,2017-11-22 15:19:48,2021-04-2316:01:32

hamiltonisoverrat3d,"Read the letter AWS sent to Parler here:

https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/johnpaczkowski/amazon-parler-aws

Here is Amazon’s letter to Parler in full.

Dear Amy,

Thank you for speaking with us earlier today.

As we discussed on the phone yesterday and this morning, we remain troubled by the repeated violations of our terms of service. Over the past several weeks, we’ve reported 98 examples to Parler of posts that clearly encourage and incite violence. Here are a few examples below from the ones we’ve sent previously: [See images above.]

Recently, we’ve seen a steady increase in this violent content on your website, all of which violates our terms. It’s clear that Parler does not have an effective process to comply with the AWS terms of service. It also seems that Parler is still trying to determine its position on content moderation. You remove some violent content when contacted by us or others, but not always with urgency. Your CEO recently stated publicly that he doesn’t “feel responsible for any of this, and neither should the platform.” This morning, you shared that you have a plan to more proactively moderate violent content, but plan to do so manually with volunteers. It’s our view that this nascent plan to use volunteers to promptly identify and remove dangerous content will not work in light of the rapidly growing number of violent posts. This is further demonstrated by the fact that you still have not taken down much of the content that we’ve sent you. Given the unfortunate events that transpired this past week in Washington, D.C., there is serious risk that this type of content will further incite violence.

AWS provides technology and services to customers across the political spectrum, and we continue to respect Parler’s right to determine for itself what content it will allow on its site. However, we cannot provide services to a customer that is unable to effectively identify and remove content that encourages or incites violence against others. Because Parler cannot comply with our terms of service and poses a very real risk to public safety, we plan to suspend Parler’s account effective Sunday, January 10th, at 11:59PM PST. We will ensure that all of your data is preserved for you to migrate to your own servers, and will work with you as best as we can to help your migration.

My personal opinion is that if a platform doesn't moderate, the user should be responsible for their posts. If someone is making statements that are outside the bounds of free speech, arrest them.

What scares me the most is companies like Apple, Google, AWS essentially have the power to control the flow of information. Parler today, what about a movement to prioritize information based on race and ethnicity? Slippery slope  

Personally I think Parler should stay for 2 reasons, the right can have its echo chamber and ideas can still be challenged.  if there is plotting, it is out in the open for authorities to make quick work of. What you’re essentially going to get now is more people discovering places like 4chan and getting rubbed up with even more insane ideas. 

I’ll say this for those sensitive ears out there, I’ve seen this vitriol on both -BOTH- sides.",https://www.reddit.com/r/malaysia/comments/kv23bx,2021-01-11 22:09:55,2021-04-2316:01:32

>	Today, Epic Games took the unfortunate step of violating the App Store guidelines that are applied equally to every developer and designed to keep the store safe for our users. As a result their Fortnite app has been removed from the store. Epic enabled a feature in its app which was not reviewed or approved by Apple, and they did so with the express intent of violating the App Store guidelines regarding in-app payments that apply to every developer who sells digital goods or services.

>	Epic has had apps on the App Store for a decade, and have benefited from the App Store ecosystem - including it’s tools, testing, and distribution that Apple provides to all developers. Epic agreed to the App Store terms and guidelines freely and we’re glad they’ve built such a successful business on the App Store. The fact that their business interests now lead them to push for a special arrangement does not change the fact that these guidelines create a level playing field for all developers and make the store safe for all users. We will make every effort to work with Epic to resolve these violations so they can return Fortnite to the App Store.

Apple provides Hardware and a means of Software Distribution that makes it easy for both the user and developers to get there Apps out to the public and make money.

If Epic has an issue with it then I welcome them to produce their own phones and manage their own store and build it up.  They definitely aren’t short on the money to do it.

To expect Platform Holders like Google and Apple to not take their cut because Epic thinks there video game is bigger than the entire ecosystem is just absurd.

m_de41,"To be completely honest here, it seems that many people are unaware of the way App Store profit cuts work and think it is just Apple ""abusing power."" As someone who develops apps for iOS, I personally think that the 30% cut that everybody is talking about is reasonable. Apple is actually generous with their platform, providing developers with the opportunity to seamlessly distribute their apps/games to users and ensure the consumers they are getting a secure product. The ideology behind the App Store is enough to make Apple big enough to take this 30% cut.

Others have been comparing this lawsuit to Netflix and Spotify for example, but these payment methods (sending the user to purchase a subscription in a browser) are not what Epic Games was attempting. Netflix and Spotify's methods are not encouraged by Apple, but are not so obvious that they would encourage a lawsuit over it. Epic Games is trying Apple by breaking the rules, which are very clear, and most of them can be found [here](https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/). Every developer follows these and doesn't whine about them. It is just part of developing for iOS.

And I am almost sure for this case, Apple will be seen as more lawful here, because they set rules which are to be followed, and there is nothing Apple protects more than the App Store. And another thing to remember: while Epic Games has planned this out (it's obvious), Apple has fought this fight for years, and they are very prepared as well.",https://www.reddit.com/r/malaysia/comments/i95vei,2020-08-14 05:46:14,2021-04-2316:01:32

sonicmario123,"This may be an unpopular opinion but I’m siding with Apple. Epic did violate a very clearly stated policy. Their argument of it being unfair and Target analogy makes no sense when it applied to the iPhone ecosystem. Apple is moving towards a very strict and very needed pro consumer privacy policy as evident with the additions of iOS 14. They shouldn’t be required or even need to allow a 3rd party App Store because they have to protect the security of people’s phones, and with a third party App Store there is no way for Apple to 100% guarantee the security and safety of a person’s info since they would have no vetting power over the apps on a 3rd party store. Yeah the 30% fee may be a lot but honestly Epic can afford it, they make enough money on young, dumb and impressionable kids spending parents money anyways.",https://www.reddit.com/r/malaysia/comments/i95vei,2020-08-14 05:40:12,2021-04-2316:01:32

shiggity-shwa,"My question is if Apple will counter sue over the blatant violation of the TOS. It was a direct link to a competing store for users to enter and use payment details, INSIDE THE APP. How many parents are going to find charges on their statements this month? It was a malicious and nefarious attempt to circumvent the company that hosts their files and updates. Does Epic want free use of Apple’s servers at no charge? If their argument is “Apple is a big company and they can afford it” then Epic should look in the mirror. $20 for a skin that’s only available for a brief amount of time? And oh, I have a few extra V Bucks left over, but not enough to buy anything. Better buy more V Bucks! I’m glad they dropped loot boxes (reluctantly, after the governments of the world pressured the industry) but their store front is still pretty damned shifty. If they can’t abuse people’s urges to gamble, then they’ll abuse the FOMO of those same weak willed individuals. 

This is just a big company trying to save/make more money. Don’t fall for their BS about this being some “for the people” altruistic cause. The fact they had their smear campaign at the ready is proof they did this on purpose, and goaded Apple into a battle by manipulating their (largely young) player base. 

Apple takes a similar cut as other companies. Should we sue Microsoft for taking a cut of every Windows PC? Valve for taking a cut? Sony? Google? How about Best Buy? They take a cut of everything sold in their store. That causes prices to be more expensive than wholesale. They’re profiting off the products they sell, even though they did not make them. Isn’t that unfair?

No, because we can buy stuff from another store. We can also buy Fortnite from other suppliers for other devices. We don’t HAVE to buy Apple products. Same principal.",https://www.reddit.com/r/malaysia/comments/i95vei,2020-08-14 09:45:04,2021-04-2316:01:32

SimonR2905,"Hear me out:

Epic had this whole thing planned out for a big publicity stunt trying to paint themselves as the selfless hero and Apple as the villain. That is not the case.

Epic deliberately broke a rule that will lead to removal from the Apple App Store & Google Play Store which makes the game unavailable to billions of users. They knew this was gonna happen.

They always had the same prices ($10 for 1000V-Bucks) on all devices wether they had to give 30% away or not. Again, this is a publicity stunt nothing more.

Apple also owns the App Store and promoted Fortnite multiple times and they make it easily accessible to billions of potential players, most of whom would be spending money on V Bucks eventually. The App Store needs to create revenue just like the Google Play Store because servers and server rooms cost money.

This is a petty campaign that denied hundreds of millions of players the access to Fortnite for some good press and a legal battle against Apple which they’re probably gonna lose.",https://www.reddit.com/r/malaysia/comments/i95vei,2020-08-14 09:15:56,2021-04-2316:01:32

-Gwynbleidd,"There are two channels at play here. Yeah, undeniably apple could squash the company into the ground, as it could with pretty much any company that has an app in the App Store. But this isn’t a money issue, this is a trust issue. 
If apple allow people use their own payment methods then they do it for one they have to do it for all and then they can’t control it and if people start scamming people then it damages the apple brand not the random company. Company can shut down, change name and reopen a week later, apple cant do that. 

Fortnite see it as apple taking their money for their product which is fair enough, but 100% of the people playing fortnite care about fortnite. But a fraction of the apple user base cares about fortnite. Personally, I want to see companies grow from using apple and undoubtedly fortnite is making money from their program on the apple infrastructure but I personally own about friggin 8 apple products. In my office there is about 40 people who the large majority of them own apple products and no one plays fortnite. I like that apple has systems in place that protects me and so I give my information to them. If I was at a higher risk I would be less hesitant to give them my information, which then hurts the apple brand. 

I see both sides in this argument, and I would be disappointed if apple opened themselves up which I can’t see happening but hopefully they can agree on something middle ground.",https://www.reddit.com/r/malaysia/comments/i95vei,2020-08-14 10:11:13,2021-04-2316:01:32

kasakka1,"What does it say about Apple’s new features when this was the thing that excited me most?

After every WWDC I feel like a second class iOS user when they demonstrate features that will probably not be available for years in my country, Finland.

I am still hoping they add *prediction* in Finnish to the stock keyboard when every Android phone has had this for more than a decade. 

If even basic thing like that is not there, what hope do I have for say better Maps over here? Small country, Maps is significantly worse here than Google Maps. In the same way almost nobody uses Messages for anything but SMS here, WhatsApp etc are more popular. I don’t know anyone who uses Apple Music either. While some of this is just different usage preferences, being a Californian means you get a far better Apple experience in general.",https://www.reddit.com/r/malaysia/comments/hdxmzf,2020-06-23 03:53:14,2021-04-2316:01:32

go_fer_it_Rock,"When Steve Jobs introduced the first iPhone, he used the “3-in-1” animation to highlight the “revolutionary” breakthroughs that the phone was bringing to the world. It’s interesting now, looking back at it, how things have changed. Here was the crowd’s reaction in 2007:

Steve: “A wide screeen iPod with touch controls!”

Crowd: **WOOO!!!! YEAH!!!!!!** 👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼

Steve: “A revolutionary mobile phone”

Crowd: **OMG!!!! YES! WOOOO! AHHHHHH!** 🙌🏼🙌🏼🙌🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼🙌🏼🙌🏼🙌🏼🙌🏼

Steve: And a breakthrough internet communications device...

Crowd: 👏🏼


Look at us now:

I probably use my “iPhone” for phone calls once a month. Seriously. Never call or get calls NEARLY as much as I did in 2007. It’s about 99% text communication only.

iPod? Nope. It’s YouTube and Spotify now (granted...I recognize that many apps use the same functionality that the original “iPod App” used). 

Internet Communicator: BINGO! This 3rd element of Steve’s presentation was SPOT ON! THIS is what changed the world. Think about how much we “communicate” with the internet on our phones now (um....hello, reddit). 

My point:

yes...it’s taken a while for the iPhone to lose the full screen phone call animation, but that could have been because it’s *called* the *”iPhone.”*

Now, this thing is effectively an internet connected camera that does almost everything you need to do...and makes phone calls when you need to be “last century.”",https://www.reddit.com/r/malaysia/comments/hdxmzf,2020-06-23 06:01:36,2021-04-2316:01:32
