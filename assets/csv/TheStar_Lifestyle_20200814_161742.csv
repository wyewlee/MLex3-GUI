Its broad all-day a la carte menu brings together an eclectic selection of Indian, Malay, Chinese and international flavours.
Appetisers include sizzling Jumbo Chicken Satay with condiments and peanut sauce, served on a mini charcoal grill.
Juicy mouthfuls are assured with the Grilled Scallop and Prawns with baby salad leaves while refreshment comes in the form of Butternut Squash Soup and Chilled Green Pea Mint Soup.

Otherwise, go for the juicy Chicken Tikka Masala which is slow-braised in spiced curry sauce. It comes with rice and condiments.
Nicely charred Tandoori Chicken, Lamb and Tiger Prawns and Chicken Seekh Kebab should also appeal to many. Have them with naan bread.
For desserts, try Ketayap Mangga which is a crepe rolled with grated coconut, mango slices, mango puree and palm sugar. New York Cheese Cake is also delicious.
