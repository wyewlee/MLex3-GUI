exjr_,"I have chosen to sticky this post as this is an important matter that should concern us all.

To have an idea of what’s going on, read this excerpt by /u/cocobandicoot:

>	Net neutrality today is about preventing abuse. It protects consumers from mega corporations and Internet service providers from (potentially) making major changes in how the Internet works, including (among other things) the possibility of charging users for the types of content they enjoy, rather than treating all data equally. That's a pretty big deal, and not out of the realm of possibility based on comments from ISPs, as well as a number of examples of how ISPs have already started abusing their power.

>	There isn't enough competition in the ISP market to go without net neutrality, and these corporations are working hard to lobby politicians into enacting laws that prevent or make it difficult for new ISPs to be successful.

>	For all these reasons, if we want the Internet to continue to work the way it has all these years, you should be encouraging your representatives to urge the FCC to keep net neutrality and ""Title II"" (2) regulation.

>	ISPs already have proven that without rules in place, they will behave in a way that can dictate how you use your internet connection.

We don’t have much time left. The Federal Communications Commissions (FCC) will vote to eliminate Net Neutrality on December 14th. 

In the OP, you can put your phone number to let the U.S. Congress now that you don’t want this at all. Verizon, AT&T, Time Warner and Comcast are looking to control what you see and what you can access!

And this is why we need to fight for an open, free internet.

Rules I like to follow :

• Always use a VPN (/r/Nologsvpn). This will encrypt your data so that no third parties are able to get it (ISPs etc) it also helps bypass Geo blocks, and protocol throttling.

• Keep your social media usage as little as possible.

• Use throwaway accounts on Reddit. Especially if you give away identifying information or post in local subreddits.

• Extra tip, use PGP on sensitive exchanges.

WDJ1924,"The mis-direction and public gullibility is staggering.  ""Net Neutrality"" is a wolf in sheep's clothing.  DO THE RESEARCH !  ""Net Neutrality"" by the previous FCC put Internet Services under Title 2 of the Communications  Act of 1934. That's right 1934 !  The Title 
 2 portion of the Communications Act of 1934 controls and regulates landline telephone service. So the former FCC, in the guise of ""Net Neutrality"" equated landline phone service and Internet Services for regulation purposes!!  Who in their right mind can call that a good thing.  The Internet has flourished because it has  NOT been regulated as a landline phone...the past FCC changed that with the ""Net Neutrality"" lie designated Internet Service as a Title 2 service.

""Net Nuetrality"" means two things...government control and taxation.  Look at your Internet bill....no tax is paid!!!!!  Under Title 2 inclusion by the previous FCC, that door is opened !!!

Stop with the nonsensical big bad wolf corporation rhetoric and do the research.  Having Internet Service regulated under an Act created in 1934 for landline telephone service is ridiculous.

Wake up!  The Net Neutrality lie is about Government  Control and the ability to Tax Internet Service at  the Federal level !!!! ",https://www.reddit.com/r/malaysia/comments/7enkwk,2017-11-23 00:38:59,2021-04-2316:29:41

ThomasMaker,"Something doesn't smell right...

First false information in a formula:

""these big companies support net neutrality, so it's bad"", then they proceed to list companies that are actually AGAINST NN.

https://www.opensecrets.org/news/issues/net_neutrality/

VERIZON, ATT, COMCAST have all lobbied excessively AGAINST NN.

There is a reason. You need to dig deeper to understand. They aren't trying to stop censorship. They are censorship. They already censor all over the web. They already censor media from trending on social media. They tell us some links are fake news. Hell, they censor us on this website right now. The hypocrisy is overwhelming. The censorship is here. What people don't get is that it is already happening but ask yourself if sites are already being censored then why do the globalists want NN? It's real simple. They will selectively enforce. They will allow their buddies to break the rules and enforce the rules against their opponents. Better to remove the rules so everyone is on an even playing field and then use anti trust laws already on the books to stop them from targeting businesses. Before NN there were almost no cases of actual abuse. Don't give me some bs link about some isp in Canada. Also, all that abuse was already illegal based on our current laws for antitrust and consumer protections. Right now we need to get rid of the title 2 regulations so people can get more service provider options. Then if your isp starts slowing certain traffic you can switch.

There is an end game here. It is not just what you see right now on the front page. Remove NN, remove title 2, allow more ISPs to compete, if they provide bad service you can switch to one that will not slow traffic. That is the real plan, not reddit's bullshit. And if you want to argue the ISPs will not compete because they like to create monopolies I still say it's better to have no regulation and antitrust laws than regulation that can be selectively enforced by the globalists if they get the right people in office. We aren't going to let them control everything. Things were working just fine before NN and they will work just fine after NN.",https://www.reddit.com/r/malaysia/comments/7enkwk,2017-11-22 20:09:21,2021-04-2316:29:41

If they won't provide it we need to take that money back from the isp's in taxes to fund and build a government maintained alternative free public internet.

,"In the past, I was very vocal about net neutrality but a lot's changed
politically since now & then that makes me think that regardless
of who gets their way & the outcome, this is a very bad time
for anyone to take a reactionary position considering the series of
L's the left has racked up.  Before these regulations were put
in place, all of these nightmare scenarios largely rested upon
corporations buying policy that makes things worse & ISP's
illegally colluding to agree not to compete when it comes to
extorting users into paying for tiered service.
Obviously there's less nightmarish anti-competative actions
that we've already seen happen in the past like slowing down
Netflix but I can't help but feel like Net Neutrality riling people
up every year or 2 could be used as a psychological tactic
that brings people together across party lines in fear of losing
a part of life that we take for granted.  A subconscious reality
check like that is definitely a good idea & without sounding like
I'm making a Thanksgiving pun, right now is a great time to
attempt a little reset like that on our collective political conscience.


And as a side note, I found it interesting that the increased news
coverage suddenly had my parents both asking me what exactly
""net neutrality"" means since they remember me talking about
it years ago.  It's not every day that I get to explain something
complicated without quickly getting a ""Never mind, I'm too dumb
for this"" or ""Since I can't defend my pre-programming in this
discussion, I'm just going to shut the discussion down by slinging
bullshit in all directions until you fatigue & walk away"".",https://www.reddit.com/r/malaysia/comments/7enkwk,2017-11-22 15:19:48,2021-04-2316:29:41
