  "description": "Select the folder where the files reside (below the payload field). In the dialog make sure to check the option \"Add files as nodes\". Alternatively, you can manually add filenames as nodes, e.g. \"amazing-speech.flac\".\n\nSet <bucket> parameter to the name of you bucket, e.g. \"myfancyusername-myfancybucket\".\n\nSet the correct content-type for the file. See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Media_type for information about content types.\n\nCheck the result at https://console.cloud.google.com/storage/browser.\n\n__Authorization notes__\n\nYou need to register an app at Google Cloud Platform: https://console.cloud.google.com. Enable Cloud Storage JSON API and create OAuth2-Credentials. In Facepager, open the authorization settings (next to Login-button) and provide Client ID and Client Secret fields. Then you are ready to login with Facepager, which gets you an access token. Make sure the header option or param option is selected in the box next to the access token.\n\nAlternatively, you can get a request token from https://developers.google.com/oauthplayground/. Add request token as header: \"Authorization: Bearer [OAUTH2_TOKEN]\". Attention: the token is preceded by the string \"Bearer \".\n",
