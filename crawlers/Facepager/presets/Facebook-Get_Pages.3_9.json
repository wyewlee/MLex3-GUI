In case you want to fetch more data just add the fields you like. For example, add \"likes\" to get to know which pages this page liked. See https://developers.facebook.com/docs/graph-api/reference/page/ for more possibilities.\n\nNotice: If you add more fields, also add them in the column setup to make the data visible in the nodes view.\n",
