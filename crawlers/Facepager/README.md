Facepager was made for fetching public available data from YouTube, Twitter and other websites on the basis of APIs and webscraping. All data is stored in a SQLite database and may be exported to csv. 

### Installer

Installation packages for each version are available on the [releases page](https://github.com/strohne/Facepager/releases). Database files may be incompatible between versions.

- **Windows**: Download and execute the latest exe-installer from the [releases page](https://github.com/strohne/Facepager/releases). If Windows complains about an unknown publisher and refuses to launch the app click "More info" and start anyway.
- **Mac OS X**: Download and unzip the app.zip-file from the [releases page](https://github.com/strohne/Facepager/releases), drag & drop the app to your "Applications" folder and open the app. A warning shows up, that the developer is not verified and Apple warns you to install the programm. You can click on the little questionmark in the right upper corner to get step-by-step instructions about how you can install the programm. In essence, you need to allow the installation of non-app-store applications in the system security settings. If you do not want to change your security settings permanently, you may open Facepager by Ctrl+Click on the icon (each time on startup). See https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/open-a-mac-app-from-an-unidentified-developer-mh40616/mac for further information.

- **Linux**: There is no binary release, see [src/readme.md](https://github.com/strohne/Facepager/blob/master/src/readme.md) for steps to run under linux.

If you want to run from source, see [src/readme.md](https://github.com/strohne/Facepager/blob/master/src/readme.md).
